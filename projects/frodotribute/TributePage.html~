# Tribute Page tests

# Technology Stack
1. Use HTML, and Plain CSS to complete this project. 

# Content
1. Yes: My tribute page should have an element with corresponding id="main", which contains all other elements.
2. Yes: I should see an element with corresponding id="title", which contains a string (i.e. text) that describes the subject of the tribute page (e.g. "Dr. Norman Borlaug").
3. Yes: I should see either a <figure> or <div> element with corresponding id="img-div".

4. Within the "img-div" element, I should see an <img> element with a corresponding id="image".
5. Within the "img-div" element, I should see either a <figcaption> or <div> element with a corresponding id="img-caption" that contains textual content describing the image shown in "img-div".
6. I should see an element with a corresponding id="tribute-info", which contains textual content describing the subject of the tribute page.
7. I should see an <a> element with a corresponding id="tribute-link", which links to an outside site that contains additional information about the subject of the tribute page. HINT: You must give your element an attribute of target and set it to "_blank" in order for your link to open in a new tab (i.e. target="_blank").

# Layout
1. The <img> element should responsively resize, relative to the width of its parent element, without exceeding its original size.
2. The <img> element should be centered within its parent element.
